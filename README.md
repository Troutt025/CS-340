# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I write programs that are maintainable by testing my code often. Making sure the code is error free with each line is crucial in maintaining code easily. To make sure it's readable I follow good practices. Examples include camelCasing and proper spacings in lines. Finally, to make sure my code is adaptable I always try to compartmentalize. Making sure code is compartmentalized and making functions wherever possible to make sure it is reusable makes sure my code is adaptable to any situation.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My first step with approaching a problem as a computer scientist is to compartmentalize the problem. Breaking the problem down to its barest properties allows me to view the problem one small issue at a time.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
To me, computer scientists use technology to solve real world problems. A good example would be the use of databases to organize data. The real world problem is that the sheer amount of data that a company can keep is far too large for paper and pencil organization. Using technology to create databases and organize data that is searchable has excellent real world applications to easily sort needed data.
